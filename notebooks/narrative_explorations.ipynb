This prediction was largely driven by the student's mother being a teacher, which positively contributed to the prediction. Having a mother in a teaching profession likely provided the student with a supportive and academically-oriented environment, increasing their chances of passing. On the other hand, the student's two absences from school had a negative impact on the prediction, suggesting that even a relatively low number of absences can hinder academic performance. The student's lack of past class failures also contributed positively to the prediction, indicating that they had a strong academic foundation. Additionally, the student's moderate frequency of going out with friends, which is below the average, may have helped them maintain a balance between social life and academic responsibilities, further supporting the prediction. Overall, the model's prediction was influenced by a combination of factors, with the student's family background and academic history playing a significant role, while their social habits and attendance had a smaller but still notable impact.\n",
