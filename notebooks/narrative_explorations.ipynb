      "        Dataset description: The dataset contains information from the 1970s in Germany on a series of debtors that took a loan from the bank. It includes many detailed categorical and one-hot variables about their financial situation. Keep in mind that at the time Germany used Deutsche Marks (DM) with an average yearly salary of 10 000 to 20 000 DM,\n",

      "\n",
      "        The LLM returned the following narrative: The model predicted a 30% probability that the customer would be a good credit risk, ultimately classifying them as a bad credit risk. The most influential factor in this prediction was the status of the customer's savings account, which indicated no savings account. This lack of savings likely signaled financial instability, contributing negatively to the probability of being a good credit risk. The amount of credit requested was also significant, with the customer asking for 7,763 DM, a figure considerably higher than the average credit request. This large amount might have raised concerns about the customer's ability to repay, further decreasing the likelihood of a positive credit outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, the duration of the credit request, set at 48 months, was longer than typical, suggesting a prolonged financial obligation that could increase the risk of default. Lastly, the status of the checking account, which showed no checking account, added to the negative outlook. This absence might imply limited financial management or resources, reinforcing the model's prediction. In summary, the combination of no savings, a high credit amount, an extended duration, and no checking account led the model to predict a higher risk of credit default.\n",
